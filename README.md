# currency-rates
Fetch and show currency rates and update every second.

## Task:
List all currencies you get from the endpoint (one per row). Each row has an input where you can enter any amount of money. When you tap on a currency row it should slide to the top and it's input becomes the first responder. When youâ€™re changing the amount the app must simultaneously update the corresponding value for other currencies.

## Solution

Fetch the currencies with rates from the end point each second. 

|Currency|Rate|
|---|---|
|AUD|1.595|
|BGN|1.977|
|BRL|4.221|
|CAD|1.143|
|CHF|7.737|
|CNY|25.96|
|DKK|7.529|
|GBP|0.887|
|HKD|25.96|
|...|...|

Convert response in a way to use in the presentation and show list of currency rates in a list and update every second.
